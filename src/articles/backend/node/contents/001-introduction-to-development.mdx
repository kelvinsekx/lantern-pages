Welcome to our first lesson. Let's dive in.

## What is Node?

Node is an **open source** and **multiplatform runtime environment** for **JavaScript**.

JavaScript is a programming language originally designed to run in web browsers only. If you built anything in Javascript before node existence, it was cursed to run on the browser. If it is run outside of it, it won't work.

Node changed this presets, allowing developers to build application that work in and outside the browser. Thanks to this innovative, open source and free solution we can now run javascript in machines, iot devices and the popular server.

## Who introduced the world of node?

Ryan Dahl started Node project in 2009. In its core, Node enabled developers to use the JavaScript language on any machine without needing a web browser. How simple node could spin-off a web server caught everyone's attention. It adopted and expands on the same event-driven model as in the browser that web developers are familiar with, contributing to its popularity with web devs.

  It is important to familiarize with people who develop these softwares. The
  knowledge can help drive a desire to know more about them and why the solution
  were original designed.

## Things you can build with Node

Node is popular for being a server language. But it can do so much more. Node can do more than just spinning off servers and APIs.

Some popular areas where node shines are with **servers**, **web app** and **command line tools**. As you continue in this course, this will hit home.

## Node's features

The fundamental concepts node is built on can be said to be its features. They are and not limited to:

1. Single Threadness
2. Event Based
3. Concurrency
4. Asynchronous

These features will be discussed later in the course.

## Closing

**It's not difficult**. This may sound cliche, it is the right mindset to have. It may take time and require a lot of concentration and asking of questions. Like every other learning experience or adjustments, they come with some difficulties. Nothing new.

We intend to make it easier. We will start from simple before doing things that may look harder as we try more complex things.

Enough for today. Thank you for reading thus far. Consistency is all that matters. And reaching this last paragraph shows you mean business.
