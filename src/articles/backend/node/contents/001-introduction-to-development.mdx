## What is node?

**Node** is an open source and multiplatform **runtime environment** for **javascript**.

JavaScript was originally designed to run in web browsers only. If you built anything in Javascript before node, it was cursed to run on the browser and when it is run outside it, it won't work.

Node changed this presets, allowing developers to build application that work in and outside the browser. Thanks to this innovative, open source, solution we can now run javascript in machines, iot devices and the popular servers.

While Javascript is the language, Node isn't. It however empowers us to run javascript language in any environment hence it's a **runtime environment**.

<AsideNote>
  If this is your first time hearing about Node or Javascript, please read along
  as we would explain these concepts again and again until you understand them.
  Very soon you would even be writing life changing softwares with them.

## Who introduced the world of node?

Ryan Dahl started Node project in 2009. In its core, Node enables developers to use the JavaScript language on any machine without needing a web browser. Node adopts and expands on the same event-driven model as in the browser. Most of Node's built-in modules are event-driven and can be used asynchronously without blocking the main thread of execution that your code runs in.

It is important to familiarize with people who develop this software. The knowledge can help drive a desire to know more about them and why the solution were original designed. But that is not the goal for us here. A google search of their name can open up a lot of info you may want.

## Things to build with Node

Node is popular with being said to be a server side language. We have mentioned it previously why this pov is wrong. It is not a language.

Another popular area where node is popular for is with web servers. It will be of great help to emphasize that Node is not limited to APIs or web servers. As you continue in this course, this will hit home.

## Features

When Node came into the scene, it made some things look trivia. The fundamental abilities node are built on can be said to be its features like:

1. Single Thread
2. Event Based
3. Concurrency
4. Asynchronous

These features will be discussed later in the course. Again, there is plenty of time and opportunity to truly understand these things as you go on.

## Closing

### It's not difficult

While this may sound cliche, it is the right mindset to have. It may take time and require a lot of concentration and asking of questions, but just like every other learning experience or adjustments, they come with difficulties.

People who hate change do not grow. So be open to the struggles. We intend to make it easier, we start simple but things may look harder as we tend to want to do more complex things.

With Node, your primary duty is to write callbacks.
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of an operation. Again, we will retouch elaborately on **Callbacks** later in the module.

## Enough for today

Thank you for reading thus far. My advice is do not rush it. Consistency is all that matters. And thank you for letting lantern pages guide you in your programming journey.
