Node is fundamentally built on async and the event loop fundamentals. When we say things run in async in Node, we mean they run asynchronously.
Async is both a concept and keyword in Node. We will discuss what the keyword does later in this chapter. For now, we will focus on understanding it as a core concept Node is built on.

Async means tasks are not forced to wait after another. If something wants more time, it should have while the rest of the tasks go on with their responsibilites.

For example, **the process of sewing by one person is synchronous**. As a taylor, you can not stich a cloth until they are cut in pieces patterns. After cutting, you would have to weave (depending on the material) before sewing and so on. In a nutshell, you can not go on with another process until the first is done.

But let's use another example with Bakers. This process can be async. For example, you may be spreading cream while the machine is mixing the cake. If it is done to taste, you can leave what you are doing to go back to the mixed cake.

These scenarios represent Async and Sync concepts well. Async guarantees your node program can keep running while another piece of the program is doing something else that usually takes time or slow.

## Callbacks

One of node.js style of empowering us to do things asynchromously is with callbacks. Callbacks are functions that are called after a task is done.

Using our baking example, imagine giving an instruction that if the bake is done smoothing, a sound should peep.

```bash
cake("be mixing", (err, done){
    if(!err){
        done(peep)
    }
})
```

A popular computer example would be reading from the drive or filesystem. Until recently faster computers, it takes a substantial time to read from drives. You don't want to delay your entire program waiting for a feedback from your drive.

```bash
console.log("Hello")
filesystem.read('file', (err, done)) // takes 10 secs
console.log("What do you want from me")
```

If `filesystem.read` is not async, it will take 10 secs before we can print "what do you want from me".

## Async in series and parallel

An example where this shine is trying to read all the files in a directory.

We might be tempted to do this.

```bash
fs.readdir('foldername', (err, files){
    if(err) throw new Error(err)
    files.forEach((f)=> {
        fs.readFile(f, (err, result){
            if(err){
                throw new Error(err)
            }
            console.log(result.length)
        })
    })
})
```

The problem with our former example is that the length of files would not come in the order of the files in our directory.

```bash
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

fs.readdir("ddd", (err, files)=>{
  if(err) throw new Error(err);

  function readFiles(i){
    if(i >=files.length) return; // exit
   fs.readFile(path.join("ddd", files[i]), (err, content)=> {
    if(err) throw new Error(err);
    console.log(content.toString())
    readFiles(i+1)
  })
 }

 readFiles(0)

})
```

There are a number of ways to solve this but I prefer to use recursion. The problem with this approach of mine is that the async operations are not made at parallel. Instead they are made one after the other which can be slow too except in cases line we do where the files in dir aren't much.
