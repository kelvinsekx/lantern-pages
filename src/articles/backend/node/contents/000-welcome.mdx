# Hello Node.js!

Welcome to the backend Node.js learning track. Here, you'll explore backend development from its fundamentals to advanced mastery using Node.js, like doing basic JavaScript execution to building robust web servers, APIs and microservices.

This guide is designed to be practical, detailed and approachable, with hands-on examples and simplified explanations. However, we have some assumptions about you the learner.

> **Before you continue, we have some assumptions about the you, the learner:**
>
> - You have some prior experience with programming (in any language).
>   Knowledge of JavaScript and Typescript is a plus. We do not expect you to be an expert in these languages, but that you should know how to write simple expressions and statements with them.
> - You know how to navigate the terminal or command-line to run instructions on the terminal.

If you do not meet these conditions, you may struggle with some parts of the contents.

## What Lantern isn't

Lantern is not a beginner guide to programming. Instead it is designed to favour complete beginner-expert (someone with at least 6 month experience programming in JS/TS) in backend development.
