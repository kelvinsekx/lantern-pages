# Hello Node.js!

Welcome to the Node.js learning track.

I started my programming career with being a frontend developer. 3+ years within the specialization, I've wanted to transition into backend development smoothly and in my own pace. The problem was there were very little resources to put me on a track to compete for senior/intermediate backend roles that felt relatable, indepth and structured. This is the problem Lantern Pages aim to solve.

Here, you'll master the art of building scalable server-side applications. These tracks are structured, simple and indepth to guide you from basic node to core runtime fundamentals and to architecting production-ready APIs and microservices.

Our approach is hands-on: you'll move quickly from theoretical concepts to building real-world projects with actionable explanations and code.

> **Before you continue, we have some assumptions about you, the learner:**
>
> - You have fundamental programming experience (in any language).
>   While we don't expect mastery, you should be comfortable with basic typescript or javascript statement or expression. i.e you understand the difference between a programming statement and expression.
> - You can confidently navigate the terminal (CLI) to run commands and navigate file system.

If you do not meet these conditions, you may struggle with some parts of the contents.

## Is Lantern right for you?

Lantern is not a beginner introduction to programming. It is a specialized path for developers looking to transition into professional backend engineering in a short time.
