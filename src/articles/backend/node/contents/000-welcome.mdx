# Hello Node.js!

Welcome to the backend Node.js learning track. Here, you'll explore the fundamentals and advanced concepts of backend development using Node.js, from basic JavaScript execution to building robust web servers, APIs and microservices.

This guide is designed to be practical, detailed and approachable, with hands-on examples and clear explanations. However, we have some assumptions about you the learner.

> **Assumptions about the learner:**
>
> - You have some prior experience with programming (in any language).
>   Knowledge of JavaScript and Typescript is a plus. We do not expect you to be an expert in these languages, but that you know how to write simple expressions and statements with them.
> - You know how to navigate the terminal or command-line to run instructions on the terminal.

## What Lantern isn't

Lantern is not a beginner guide to programming. Instead it is designed to favour complete beginner-expert (someone with at least 4 month experience programming in JS/TS) in backend development.
