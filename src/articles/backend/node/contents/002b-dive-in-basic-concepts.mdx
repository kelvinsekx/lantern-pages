An usual intro. This module may feel way longer compared to previously completed ones. Please don't rush it. These are the basic concepts that complex things sit on. Skipping this phase may pose problems later in the course.

As you progress, don't over concentrate on concepts that feel overly difficult or confusing. We'll have a modules or sections where you will usually discuss these concepts.

## Console.log out

`console.log` in node is a web syntatic wrapper. It is a convenience for process.stdout.

Node console is a global instance configured to write to process.stdout and process.stderr. Because it is global instance, it can be used without calling `require('node:console')`.

Console.log can be used for debugging and display something to the user or drop in place use for process.stdout.

<AsideNote>
  If process.stdout, process.stderr confuse you, don't mind it. You will see
  more of it and with lengthier explanation later.
</AsideNote>

Let's run some examples in the REPL.

```bash
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v21.6.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> console.log("kelvin")
kelvin
undefined
```

In subsequent examples and the rest of the course, I will skip these terminal details and jump straight at the sample code and outputs so that the example above is written with fewer lines.

```bash
console.log("kelvin") // kelvin
```

## Command Arguments and Environment variables

### Command Arguments with `process.argv`

A Node program can read its command-line arguments from process.argv.
Process.argv is an array that contains the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched. The first element of this array is always the path to the Node executable, followed by whatever follows your node command.

Run this in a REPL

```bash
process.argv // [ '/path/to/yours/versions/node/v21.6.0/bin/node' ]
```

To explore an example, running node commands from REPL can be limiting for our case. So let's do script here.

For example, suppose you save this Node program to the file argv1.js:

```bash
// File: argv1.js
console.log(process.argv)
```

Run this command in the parent directory from where the argv1.js file is located.

```bash
$ node argv1.js

/**
[
  '/path/to/yours/versions/node/v21.6.0/bin/node',
  '/path/to/folder/argv1.js'
]
*/
```

#### A couple of things to keep in mind

1. By default when you run node via script method the second argument (argvs) is always the script name.
2. The first and second elements of process.argv will be fully qualified filesystem paths to the Node executable and the file of JavaScript that is being executed.
3. Command-line arguments that are intended for and interpreted by the Node executable itself are consumed by the Node executable and do not appear in process.argv

<LongAside subject="Arguments not in process.argv">
Arguments intended for the Node runtime (and not your script) don't appear in the process.argv. Node parses and use them before loading the JavaScript file and do not need to pass them to your program.

| Flag      | Purpose                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| --inspect | Enable the debugger                         |
| --require | preload a module before running your script |

If you want to access all arguments including those used by node, you can use `process.execArgv`.

</LongAside>

### Environment variables with `process.env`

Node programs can also take input from Unix-style environment variables. These variables are available through **process.env**.

Process.env is an object. It contains your environment variables. The property names of this object are environment variable names, and the property values (always strings) are the values of those variables.

**Why do you need to know about process.env?**

1. It is perfect for configurations or variables that might change between deployments.
2. It is simpler alternative to hide sensitive information that would have otherwise be hardcoded.

Using the REPL, run `process.env`. Its output is a long object.

To make our hands dirty, create some custom variables in a `.env` file.

```bash
//file:: .env
PORTAL="SEKX_10001"
```

Exit the REPL and restart it. Then run `process.env`. Try find your newly defined variables. Oops, you still can not find it in the output. This is because you would manually load this file if you want the variables in .env file to be included.

Run your REPL like this `node --env-file=.env`. It loads the .env file in your REPL environment. Try the process of displaying your process environment and you should see your custom variable in the list.

## Modules and npm (Node Package Manager)

Node had its module system before javascript own. This system is called CommonJS.

The then Node's module system uses the `require()` function to import values into a module and the `exports` object or the `module.exports` property to export values from a module.

In javascript, a module is typically a file. Not all programming languages behave this way. For some, multiple modules can exist in a single file.

**What is a module?**

In recent versions, after javascript rolled out it own module system, we now have 2 combined module systems available for us. This later module system is called ES6 module, and the earlier one is commonjs module. These modules are not compatible so you are forced to stick with one in your project. The recommended one is ES6 module except you are working in a legacy and large codebase written in CommonJS.

Common js

```bash
// calc.js
const add = function(a, b){
  return a  +  b;
}
exports.add

// main.js
const {add} = require('./calc.js');

console.log(add(2, 4));
```

ES6 Module

```bash
// calc.js
const add = function(a, b){
  return a  +  b;
}
exports add;

// main.js
import { add } from './calc.js';

console.log(add(2, 4));
```

The simplest way to tell Node what kind of module it is loading is to encode this information in the file extension. If you save your JavaScript code in a file that ends with .mjs, then Node will always load it as an ES6 module, will expect it to use import and export, and will not provide a require() function. And if you save your code in a file that ends with .cjs, then Node will always treat it as a CommonJS module, will provide a require() function, and will throw a SyntaxError if you use import or export declarations.

For files that do not have an explicit .mjs or .cjs extension, Node looks into the package.json file in the same directory as the file. Once the nearest package.json file is found, Node checks for a top level type property in the JSON object. If the value of the type property is "module", then Node loads the file as an ES6 module. If the value of that property is "commonjs", then Node loads the files as a CommonJS module. Note that you do not need to have a package.json file to run Node programs: when no such file is found (or when the file is found but it does not have a type property), Node defaults to using CommonJS modules.

## Node Manager Packager

On installing node, it is accompanied with the Node Package Manager, NPM. NPM is the official package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem.

NPM downloads and manage libraries you would be using in your code. It keep tracks of these dependencies (as well as other info about these dependencies) in files **package.json** and **package-lock.json** in _the root directory_.

Interesting Read: Libraries or API;

We aren't covering npm in detail here. You'll have many opportunity to learn about this manager as you go especially since you will most likely not build anything without it.

## Summary

Although we have covered a lot in this chapter, we have only scratched the surface of basic node concepts. There are many more concepts to learn and understand. We will be covering them as standalone modules.

Here are the standalone modules that will be coming up next:

1. [Asynchronous and event driven](/learn/backend/node/003-async-concepts)
2. [Core modules](../http)

If you have any questions, please ask them in the course discussion forum. If you are not sure how to do this, please refer to the [learn guide](/learn/guide).
