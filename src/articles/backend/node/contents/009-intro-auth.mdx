Authentication ( not authorization) checks for users credibility. It verifies that a user requesting resources is indeed who they claim to be. Some of the common methods to verify a user credibility are:

- Something the user knows like their password, security questions
- Something the user has such as tokens in physical devices, smart cards
- Something the user is. For example their fingerprint, facial recognition, voice

This course will focus on password-based authentication, popularly manifested as sign up and login. As you progress, we'll cover authentication, its importance and challenges, before building a robust signup and login system you can use in real world apps.

Our discussion will be guided by standard practices for mitigating threat of attackers/impersonators. Finally, we'll explore modern alternatives used to eliminate reinventing the wheel of many parts of authentication.
