The most popular Node.js web framework is Express.js. It is intended for the development of web applications and APIs. Virtually all the popular meta-frameworks and solutions are built on Express like Nest, Next, Nuxt etc.

Express saves developers time and empower them to work on what truly matters. It can be time-consuming to create a backend from scratch using node's `createServer` utilities only. Writing all the boilerplate code from port configuration, route handling etc distracts from the important task of focus on the business logic for an application.

## Create your first program

The following program will listen on port 2999 when ran. The application will responde to any client request on port:2999 irrespective of the HTTP request type. If you make a HTTP POST or HTTP GET request, the response will print "Hi, our request has been received".

```bash
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.all('/', (req, res)=> res.send("Hi, your request has been received"));

app.listen(2999, ()=> console.log("App started on 2999"));
```

1. We imported the express package
2. Create our server/application base
3. Register a route for all Routes.Methods
4. Bind the server to a port so that others can connect to it on port 2999

You can run the server with CURL if you are on a linux environment.

```bash
$: curl -X GET localhost:2999 // HTTP GET
$: curl -X POST localhost:2999 // HTTP POST
```

## Routes

Routes are one of the most important building block in Express. It consist of the application request **HTTP type**, **URL** and **accompanied route handler**. When a route is matched, **one or more** handler functions for that route are called.

In short, routing involves how the server respond to different requests (URI paths) made by clients.

```bash
<app-base>.METHOD(<URL-PATH>, HANDLER)
app.get('/login', handleLogin)
```

**The HTTP type** can be HTTP GET, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, HTTP DELETE. Learn more about HTTP methods.

**The URL path** is the endpoint that should be matched.

**The accompanied handler** is specified by the method as callback that is called when it detects a match from the client's request.

We can now extend our previous example to do more with express routes.

```bash
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res)=> res.send("Hi, your request has been received"))
app.get('/welcome', (req, res)=> res.send("<h1>Hello to Welcome</h1>"))

app.listen(2999, ()=> console.log("App started on 2999"))
```

Now that we've have made the changes, if you try connect the server from a post request you should see an error: an html error response with "Not Found"

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:2999 // HTTP POST will throw error
```

This is because we have changed the route to only accept HTTP GET and not just any method. A route path can take multiple HTTP methods. Learn more about routing here.

## NotFound

We can change our NotFound handler to send a text and not an html response like it is doing.

```bash
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res)=> res.send("Hi, your request has been received"))
app.get('/welcome', (req, res)=> res.send("<h1>Hello to Welcome</h1>"))
app.use((req, res)=> res.send("Oops! Not Found"))

app.listen(2999, ()=> console.log("App started on 2999"))
```

## Middlewares

Almost everything you will do in Express feels like a middleware. The core application object (`app` base) and the routing mechanism are built on the concepts of middleware.

For example, when you define the routes in Express using **app.get()**, **app.post()** e.t.c, the handlers passed to these functions are in essence middleware. They can receive **req**, **res** and **next** ( though next can be optional) parameters.

A middleware function is any function that has access to these parameters of **`request` object (req)** and **`response` object (res)**, and the **`next` function**.

A middleware runs at the time between when your program gets the request and before sending a response to the client.

These functions can:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request ad response objects
- End the request-response cycle (by sending a response)
- Call the next middleware function in the stack(using `next()`)

### Types of Middlewares

Express categories middleware into 5 categories:

1. Appication-level/Global middleware
   These kind of middlewares are applied to the entirenapp using `app.use()`.

2. Router-level middleware
   This one is bound to `express.Router()` instances. It is used to apply a subset of routes.

3. Error handling middleware
   This is a special function that takes four arguments (`err`, `req`, `res` `next`). They are designed to catch and handle errors.

4. Built-in middleware
   Functions like `Express.static` (for serving static files), `Express.json` (for parsing JSON request bodies) and `Express.urlencoded` (for parsing URL-enconded bodies). These are pre-built and available out of the box for you.

5. Third-party middleware
   These are modules developed by the community and can be installed using the npm package (e.g cookie-parser, body-parser, express-session, multer).

Let's make a popular logger and use it globally

```bash
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.use(logger)
app.get('/', (req, res)=> res.send("Hi, your request has been received"))
app.get('/welcome', (req, res)=> res.send("<h1>Hello to Welcome</h1>"))
app.use((req, res)=> res.send("Oops! Not Found"))

app.listen(2999, ()=> console.log("App started on 2999"))

/**
*
*/
function logger(req, res, next){
    console.log(req.originalUrl)
    next()
}
```

## Collecting Data Records

We typically send data over the server using the HTTP POST method. While there are other alternatives, this is one of the secure ways to go about it.

You can then have access to these data on the req object using the body property (req.body).

Using our simple app example, add a login route. We will print to the console the req.body and send just about any text telling us we successfully got the req.body

```bash
import express from "express";

const app = express()

app.use(logger)
app.get('/', (req, res)=> res.send("Hi, your request has been received"))
app.get('/welcome', (req, res)=> res.send("<h1>Hello to Welcome</h1>"))
app.post('/login', (req, res)=> {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.send('We received your creds. We will get back to you!')
})
app.use((req, res)=> res.status(404).send("Opps! Nothing Found"))

app.listen(2999, ()=> console.log("App started on 2999"))

/**
 *
 *
 * /
function logger(req, res, next){
  console.log(req.originalUrl, '--', new Date())
  next()
}
```

You can hit the endpoint with curl.

```bash
$: curl --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:2999/login --data '{ "name" : "kelvinsekx" }'
```

The req.body will return **undefined**. This is because express won't auto parse your req.body. We need a middleware to handle this. We will be using the built in `Express.json` middleware for this. A popular alternative is to use the BodyParser.

```bash
import express from "express";

const app = express()

app.use(express.json())

app.use(logger)
app.get('/', (req, res)=> res.send("Hi, your request has been received"))
app.get('/welcome', (req, res)=> res.send("<h1>Hello to Welcome</h1>"))
app.post('/login', (req, res)=> {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.send('We received your creds. We will get back to you!')
})
app.use((req, res)=> res.status(404).send("Opps! Nothing Found"))

app.listen(2999, ()=> console.log("App started on 2999"))

/**
 *
 *
 * /
function logger(req, res, next){
  console.log(req.originalUrl, '--', new Date())
  next()
}
```

## Conclusion

Our goal for this lesson is to make a simple introduction and examples to the core concepts on building a server with Express.

Although not important to progress to the next lesson see an advanced module where we built a complete filebased persistent restful server with Express.
