Welcome to our first lesson. Let's dive in very quickly.

## What is Node?

Node is an **open source** and **multiplatform runtime environment** for **javascript**.

JavaScript was originally designed to run in web browsers only. If you built anything in Javascript before node, it was cursed to run on the browser and when it is run outside it, it won't work.

Node changed this presets, allowing developers to build application that work in and outside the browser. Thanks to this innovative, open source and free solution we can now run javascript in machines, iot devices and the popular server.

While JavaScript is the language, Node isn't. It however empowers us to run javascript language in any environment hence the **runtime environment**.

<AsideNote>
  If this is your first time hearing about Node or Javascript, please read
  along. We would explain these concepts again and again until you understand
  them. Very soon you would even be writing life changing softwares with them.

## Who introduced the world of node?

Ryan Dahl started Node project in 2009. In its core, Node enabled developers to use the JavaScript language on any machine without needing a web browser. How simple made it to spin-off web server caught everyone's attention. It adopts and expands on the same event-driven model as in the browser that web developers could relate with.

It is important to familiarize with people who develop these softwares. The knowledge can help drive a desire to know more about them and why the solution were original designed.

## Things to build with Node

Node is popular with being said to be a server language. This pov is not true. Node can do more than just spinning off servers and APIs.

Some popular areas where node shines are with **servers**, **web app** and **command line tools**. It will be great to emphasize that Node is not limited to APIs or web servers. As you continue in this course, this will hit home.

## Features

When Node came into the scene, it made some things look trivia like spinning a server. The fundamental abilities node are built on to make these things look easy can be said to be its features. They are:

1. Single Thread
2. Event Based
3. Concurrency
4. Asynchronous

These features will be discussed later in the course. Again, there is plenty of time and opportunity to truly understand these things as you go on.

## Closing

### It's not difficult

While this may sound cliche, it is the right mindset to have. It may take time and require a lot of concentration and asking of questions. Like every other learning experience or adjustments, they come with some difficulties. Nothing new.

We intend to make it easier. We will start from simple before doing things that may look harder as we try more complex things.

## Enough for today

Thank you for reading thus far. Consistency is all that matters. And reaching this last paragraph shows you mean business.
