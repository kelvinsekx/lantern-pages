Authentication ( not Authorization) checks for users credibility. It verifies that a user requesting a resource is indeed who they claim to be. Below are common methods to verify user credibility:

- Something the user knows: password, security questions
- Something the user has: tokens in physical devices, smart cards
- Something the user is: fingerprint, facial recognition, voice

This course focuses on password-based authentication, popular as sign up and login. We would cover its importance, challenges, and carefully build a robust signup and login system from scratch. Our discussion would be guided by standard practices of mitigating threat of attackers/impersonators and alternatives employed today to reduce reinventing the wheel of building an authentication system yourself.
