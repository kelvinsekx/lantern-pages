Authentication ( not Authorization) checks a user credibility. It verifies that a user requesting a resource is indeed who they claim to be. To help us achieve this, there are a couple of common methods. They include:

- Something you know: passwords, security questions
- Something you have: tokens usually in a physical devices, smart cards
- Something you are: fingerprints, facial recognition, voice

This course focueses on password-based authentication, popular as sign up and login. We would cover its challenges, and step by step build a robust signup and login system from scratch. Our discussion would be guided with standard practice of mitigating threat of hackers/iimpersinators and what alternatives are employed today to mitigate these troubles.
