If you have Node installed on your computer, you should have the commands `node` and `npm` available in your environment. Make sure the Node version is a recent one (20.x or higher).

To verify your Node version, open a terminal and run the command `node -v`. If the prompt returns something around "command 'node' not found, ..." instead of a number, you don't have the node command.[Follow this link on instructions to download node](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## How to execute your applications

There are broadly two ways of executing node commands or codes.

1. **an interactive shell/mode**, also called REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)
2. **a script** by passing the first name of the file to node command

## Your first node in a REPL

REPLs are for simple commands. They are not intended to run complete long programs. They are more suited for testing functionalities of individual code snippets.

To get in REPL mode, run `node` in a terminal (type **node** and press `Enter`).

### REPL in action

**1. Waits**

```bash
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v<your_number>
...
>
```

**2. Read**

```bash
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v<your_number>
...
> Math.random()
```

**3. Evaluate and Print**

```bash
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v<your_number>
...
> Math.random()
> 0.0893322323219892
>
```

**4. Start from 1. Again (Loops)**

Node will read the line, evaluate and print the result, and loop over these three things for everything you type until you exit the session. To exit, press the key `Ctrl + D` or `Ctrl + C` twice or type ".exit" and hit enter in the REPL.

We are going to run the same code using script next.

## Your first node in a script

`mkdir` (make a new directory) and `cd` (change directory) into it:

```bash
$ mkdir node-example-1
$ cd node-example-1
```

Open up the directory in your favorite code editor and create a file name "test.js". Put the same `Math.random()` line into it:

```bash
//file: node-example-1/test.js

Math.random()
```

To execute that script, in the terminal, type the following command passing the file name as first argument to the node command:

```bash
$ node test.js // <node-command> <file-name>
```

You will notice the command will basically do nothing because we did not output anything in the script. To output something, you can use the global `console` object, which is similar to the one available in browsers.

```bash
//file: node-example-1/test.js

console.log(
    Math.random()
)
```

Executing node-example-1/test.js will output a random number. We're using both JavaScript (`Math` object) and an object from the Node API (`console`). Taa daa!

<LongAside subject="A little diversion to talk `console`">

The `console` object in node is similar to the one available in browsers but they are not the same.

The `console.log` method is a mask that writes the value of its arguments to the default standard output stream (stdout) of the running process.

The console object is one of many top-level global scope objects that we can access in Node without needing to declare any dependencies. Similar to how the global windows object in browsers can be accessed with the globalThis property, in Node, the globalThis property is the global object and the console object is part of it. All properties of globalThis can be accessed directly: for example, `console.log` instead of `globalThis.console.log` which also works.

If the preceeding paragraphs confuses you, again we will talk about this in other chapters.

</LongAside>

## In Conclusion

At the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with the two ways on how to run your node commands. Congratulations as nothing is too small to celebrate.
