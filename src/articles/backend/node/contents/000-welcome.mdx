Welcome to the Node.js learning track.

I started my programming career as a frontend developer. 3+ years within the specialization, I've wanted to transition into backend development. I wanted this to be smooth and in my own pace so that I can compete for senior/intermediate backend roles in months.

And there lies the problem! There were very little resources to help me achieve this especially those that felt relatable, indepth and structured for my frontend background. This is the problem Lantern Pages aim to solve.

You'll master the art of building scalable server-side applications. These tracks are intentional, simple and indepth to guide you from basic node to core runtime fundamentals and to architecting production-ready APIs and microservices.

Our approach is hands-on: you'll move quickly from theoretical concepts to building real-world projects with actionable explanations and code.

> **Before you continue, we have some assumptions about you, the learner:**
>
> - You have fundamental programming experience (in any language).
>   While we don't expect mastery, you should be comfortable with basic typescript or javascript statement or expression. i.e you understand the difference between a programming statement and expression.
> - You can confidently navigate the terminal (CLI) to run commands and navigate file system.

If you do not meet these conditions, you can still go on with this resource as some of these basic programming will be explained along the way.

## Is Lantern right for you?

Lantern, although not a beginner introduction to programming, is targeted to help devs from every levels of their career: beginner to senior. It is a specialized path for developers looking to transition into professional backend engineering in a short time.
