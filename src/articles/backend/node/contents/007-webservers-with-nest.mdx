Nest brings architecture to your app. While express doesn't enforce structure or architecture for designing your backend code, Nest does. It is a meta-framework built on top of Express. It is specially designed to aid large scale applications and large teams. Most Cos building webserver with Node use it.

In this lesson, you'll be introduced to Nest and replicate the application with Node and Express from previous lessons.

## Create your first program

1. Install nest CLI `$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli`
   - `$ nest --help` to get an overview of the available options on the command line.
   - `$ nest -v` shows the current version
2. After installation nest command will be available to use from the terminal.
   - create new application with `$ nest new project-name`
   - start the application with `$ npm run start:dev`

| command                   | short form | description                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| nest new [options] [name] |            | create a new nest application |

Luckily, Nest is compatible with both Typescript and pure JavaScript

  In the console output... If the application is extended, this is the place to
  start troubleshooting your application.

## Routes

The controller is solely responsible to handle routes in Nest. The `@controller()` decorator is used in this file. passing a path prefix can auto segment the entire controller file for you.

Core files in Nest app

| file                   | use                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app.controller.ts      | A controller with a single route                                              |
| app.controller.spec.ts | where unit tests for the app.controller.ts program resides                    |
| app.module.ts          | the root module of the application                                            |
| main.ts                | uses NestFactory with the root module to create an instanceof the Nest js App |

### Controller

Controllers are responsible for handling requests and sending their respective responses to the client.

To create CRUD controller `nest g resource [name]`

HTTP request method decorators

The route path for a handler is determined by combining the (optional) prefix declared for the controller with any path specified in the method's decorator.
