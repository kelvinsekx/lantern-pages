## What is Node?

Node is an **open source** and **multiplatform runtime environment** for **JavaScript**.

<AsideNote>
  {`Node.js is used interchangeably with Node. They mean same thing.`}
</AsideNote>

JavaScript is a programming language originally designed to run in web browsers only.
If you built anything in Javascript before node existence, it was cursed NOT to run outside
the browser.

Node changed this preset, allowing developers to build applications that work in and outside the browser seamlessly. Thanks to this innovative, and open source solution, you and I can run JavaScript in machines, iot devices and the popular server today.

Samer Buna gave one of the most complete definition of Node quoted below:

> Node is a server runtime environment that wraps V8 and provides modules to help developers build and run efficient software applications with JavaScript.

## Who introduced the world of node?

Ryan Dahl started Node project in 2009. In its core, Node enabled developers to use the JavaScript language on any machine without needing a web browser. How simple Node could spin-off a server caught the attention of the developer community. The fact that it adopted and expands on the same event-driven model as in the browser that web developers are familiar with, contributed to its popularity in the dev communities.

<AsideNote>
  It is important to familiarize with people who develop these softwares. The
  knowledge can help drive a desire to know more about them and why the solution
  were original designed.
</AsideNote>

## Things you can build with Node

Node is popular as a server language. But it can do so much more than spinning off servers and APIs.

Some popular areas where Node shines are with **web app**, **command line tools** and the popular **servers**. As you continue in this course, this will hit home.

## Node's features

The fundamental concepts Node is built on are also its features. They are and not limited to:

1. Single Threadness
2. Event Based API
3. Concurrency
4. Asynchronous

These features will be discussed later in the course.

<AsideNote note="Saw something confusing?">
  {`There will be plenty of time and opportunity to understand confusing concepts. Don't panic. Keep reading!`}

## Closing

**It's not difficult**. It sounds cliche, but it is the right mindset to have. It may take time and require a lot of concentration and questioning. However, like every other learning experience, they come with some difficulties. Nothing new.

We intend to make it easier. We will start from simple to complex.

Thank you for reading thus far. Reaching this last paragraph shows you mean business.
