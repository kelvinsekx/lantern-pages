## What is node?

**Node** is an open source and multiplatform **runtime environment** for **javascript**.

If this is your first time hearing about Node or Javascript, please read along as we would explain these concepts again and again until you understand them. Very soon you would even be writing life changing softwares with them.

JavaScript was originally designed to run in web browsers only. If you built anything in Javascript before node, it was cursed to run on the browser and when you run it outside it, it just won't work.

However, Node allows developers to run JavaScript anywhere outside or inside the browser. Thanks to this innovative, open source, solution we can now run javascript in machines, iot devices and the popular servers.

While Javascript is the language, Node isn't. It however empowers us to run javascript in any environment hence why it's a **runtime environment**.

## Who introduced the world of node?

Ryan Dahl started Node project in 2009. In its core, Node enables developers to use the JavaScript language on any machine without needing a web browser. Node adopts and expands on the same event-driven model as in the browser. Most of Nodeâ€™s built-in modules are event-driven and can be used asynchronously without blocking the main thread of execution that your code runs in.

It is important to familiarize with people who develop this software. The knowledge can help drive a desire to know more about them and why the solution were original designed. But that is not the goal for us here. A google search of their name can open up a lot of info you may want.

## Things to build with Node

Node is polarized with being used to say it is a server side language. We have mentioned it previously why this pov is wrong. It is not a language. And it will be of great help to re-emphasize again that Node isn not limited to APIs or server side. As you continue in this course, we will hit this fact home.

## Features

1. Single Thread
2. Event Based
3. Concurrency
4. Asynchronous

We would not talk about these features now. Again, there is plenty of time. But is good you have at least seen them here.

## It's not as hard as you've always think

While this may sound cliche, it is the right mindset to have. It may take time and require a lot of concentration and asking of questions, but just like very other learning experience or adjustments, it is difficult to change. People who hate change do not grow.

It's hard enough. It starts simple and get harder as you tend to want or do more complex things.

With Node, your primary duty is to write callbacks.
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of an operation. Again, we will retouch elaborately on **Callbacks** later in the module.

## Enough for today

Thank you for reading thus far. My advice is do not rush it. Consistency is all that matters. And thank you for letting lantern pages guide you in your programming journey.
