## what is node?

Node is an open source and multiplatform runtime environment for javascript.

## who introduced the world of node to us?

Ryan Dahl started NODE project in 2009. In its core, Node enables developers to use the JavaScript language on any machine without needing a web browser. Node adopts and expands on the same event-driven model as in the browser. Most of Nodeâ€™s built-in modules are event-driven and can be used asynchronously without blocking the main thread of execution that your code runs in.

## Enough with the push of threads

A thread is basically a small process within a larger one. A process can create multiple threads of execution that are each associated with a CPU core. Threads can share memory and resources within the larger process.

## It's not as hard as you've alwyas think

Many frontend developers especially begineers think of backend development as scary. In sincereity, it is not any less harder than frontend development. It starts simple and get harder as you tend to want to do more hard things.

with NODE your primary duty is to write callbacks.

Node is not limited to the web ad web servers.
